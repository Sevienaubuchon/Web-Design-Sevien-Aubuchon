			<h1> Training </h1>
			<b>
			These are some training tips from Usain Bolt himself:
			To make the first part of a sprint race your strongest element, you should improve your reaction time in order to start out of the track blocks quickly.
			Weight training is necessary because you need to develop the power to do well on the track.
			A strong core is important for sprinting.
			Do not rush to get to the top speed. Start out by leaning forward, hold the drive phase for 20-30 meters, and then accelerate gradually.
			Bolt eats the same three meals each day, and he spends 90 minutes in the gym. His speed workouts on the track make up the rest of his training. He actually lists out exactly what he does each day on <a href= "http://www.borntoworkout.com/usain-bolt-training-routine-diet-plan-tips/">this site.</a>
