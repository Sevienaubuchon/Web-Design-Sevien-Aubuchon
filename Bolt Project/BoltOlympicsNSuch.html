			<h1> Olympics n' Such </h1>
			<b>
			His first worldwide competition was in the IAAF World Youth Championships in Hungary, where he failed to qualify for the finals but set a new personal best. He did not take sports seriously until 2002, where he won the World Junior Championships at the youngest age ever to do so: 15. In fact, he was so nervous because of the crowd that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet! He participated in innumeral competitions and began rolling in medals. He would have gone to the 2004 Athens Olympics, had he not sustained a knee injury. He actually got injured a lot, and had to miss several worldwide events, including the 2005 World Championships and the 2006 Commonwealth Games, to name a few. He was very successful in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, achieving gold medals in every event and setting world records in most of them. In the 2016 Olympics, he ran the same three events as always: 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters. Again, he won gold medals in all of his events. In fact, he has come second to none in every Olympic event. He currently holds world record times in two out of his three events. He ran the fastest 100 meters in the 2016 Olympic Games with a time of 9.58. He also ran the fastest 200 meters at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 19.19 seconds. His top speed is an incredible 29.79 mph. One more amazing fact: From 2008 until now, Bolt has never lost individual competition. He has always come first, in every single one for the past eight years, except for one event where he was disqualified for a false start. No, I'm not done yet. Get ready for this. Are you ready? I don't think you are. Bolt ran 150 meters in 14.35. During that race, from the 50 meter mark to the finish line, it took him 8.70 seconds. This would have been the fastest time ever and probably would have remained that way for the next five decades. He would have smashed his world record time by just under 0.9 seconds, and that was already after having run 50 meters.
