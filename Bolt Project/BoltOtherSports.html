			Bolt has always been interested in cricket and soccer, as he has played them since his early childhood. He may play for an Australian cricket team after his running career: the manager has said that there is a spot open for him if he would like to join. He also has a good chance of making it onto Manchester United, which is arguably one of the world's best soccer teams.
